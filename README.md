# distributed-db-Appy.GitDb
Try Appy.GitDb as a Storage to achieve a fully distributed database (know if that works or not)


# what is desired is 
 * an ability to work offline with database,
 * branch a database and merge back with options
 * Receive notification when data has been changed somehow
 
 
 # actions
  * Observe what it looks like when you create an entry  
   * Does that merge?
